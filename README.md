# Regression Model for Advertising ROI Prediction ðŸ“ˆ
## Context - Introduction
A company is monthly investing in online advertising platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and newspapers to generate leads (individuals interested in their products). To monitor the performance of these investments, the company records all advertising expenses and the sales returns generated from these investments.

To better understand the relationship between the variables in these records and identify the factors that most impact lead generation, the company has sought the expertise of a data specialist.
